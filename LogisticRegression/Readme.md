## Num.NET.Examples.LogisticRegression

This example write a simple logistic regression model to classify the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). What you need to do is only clone and run it.

Please note that [Num.NET](https://github.com/SteeWing/Num.NET) is a .NET library to provide operations of tensor and .NET style interfaces. It does not plan to support the machine-learning. However, some examples of it may involves machine-learning since its features are so related with machine-learning.
